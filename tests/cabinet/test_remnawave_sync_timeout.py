"""Regression guard for the "pay button spins forever after the product is
delivered" bug.

The cabinet balance-pay endpoints (traffic top-up, renewal, subscription/tariff
purchase) commit the product and THEN sync RemnaWave inline. A slow or
unavailable panel used to hold the HTTP response open, so the cabinet pay button
(bound to the in-flight request) spun far past delivery and, on the 30s axios
timeout, errored instead of showing the delivered product.

Fix: bound each inline sync with ``asyncio.timeout(REMNAWAVE_SYNC_TIMEOUT)`` and
fall back to ``remnawave_retry_queue`` (the same branch the sync errors already
use). These tests pin that invariant.
