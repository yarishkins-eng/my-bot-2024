"""Source-level pin: cabinet ``/purchase-tariff`` must compensate (refund) when
the subscription fails to persist AFTER the balance charge is committed.

Background — the bug this defends against (#3031)
-------------------------------------------------
``subtract_user_balance`` and ``create_transaction`` commit immediately; the
subscription is created/extended afterwards. Any failure in between — an
IntegrityError from a tariff-switch race that the narrow create-branch handler
does not catch (e.g. raised by ``extend_subscription``), a transient DB/driver
error ("Single-row INSERT ... did not produce a new primary key result"), a
FlushError — used to bubble into the route-level ``except Exception``, which
returns HTTP 500 WITHOUT compensation. Prod evidence: ``transactions`` has the
``subscription_payment`` row, ``subscriptions`` has nothing — the user paid and
got nothing.

Fix shape
---------
The charge→persist section is wrapped in a guard inside ``purchase_tariff``:

- ``except HTTPException: raise`` — the 409 "already active" branch refunds
  itself; re-raising prevents a double refund;
- ``except Exception`` — log, ``db.rollback()``, refund via ``_refund_charge``,
  re-raise as HTTP 500.

``_refund_charge`` re-fetches the user with ``get_user_by_id`` because after
``db.rollback()`` ORM instances are expired and synchronous attribute access in
an async context dies with MissingGreenlet — a refund path must never depend on
live instances.

Post-persist steps (trial bonus seconds, daily-charge marker, panel sync) stay
OUTSIDE the guard on purpose: once the subscription is committed the product is
delivered, and a later failure must not hand the money back on top of it.

A full integration test would need a real DB + FastAPI deps; these tests pin
the SOURCE-LEVEL structure via AST so the guard can't silently disappear.
